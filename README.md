# Responsive-Food-App
Practice Project made with Vue (without Vue CLI because I'm learning manual Webpack configuration) and Sass. 

Application "features"

1. Register account - sign up / sign-in
2. CRUD operations using Firebase backend - user can create, read, update and delete food recipes, upload photos and search for videos of a particular meal. 
3. User can sort food by category, create categories, menus and make a diet plan.
